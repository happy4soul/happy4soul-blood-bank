    <p class="p1">If your blood is A positive (A+), it means that your blood contains type-A antigens with the presence of a protein called the rhesus (Rh) factor. Antigens are markers on the surface of a blood cell.<br><br>

According to the American Red Cross, this is one of the most common blood types.<br><br>

<strong>Why you have an A+ blood type</strong><br><br>

Blood types are passed down genetically. If you have type A blood, your parents had one of the following possible combinations of blood types:<br><br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>  AB and AB</li>
  <li>  AB and B</li>
  <li>  AB and A</li>
  <li>  AB and O</li>
  <li>  A and B</li>
  <li>  A and A</li>
  <li>  O and A</li>
</ol>







<p class="p1">
For example, both parents are type AB, or one parent is type AB and the other type B.<br><br>

Parents with the following combinations of blood types couldn’t have a child with type A blood:<br><br>

    B and B<br><br>
    O and B<br><br>
    O and O<br><br>

<strong>Blood type and personality traits</strong><br><br>

While there is no scientific proof that blood types are associated with certain personality traits, it’s a persistent theory in Japanese culture known as “ketsuekigata.”<br /><br />

According to those who believe this theory, these are the personality traits associated with the A+ blood type:<br /><br />
</p>
<ol>
  <li>  tense</li>
    <li>stubborn</li>
      <li>  earnest</li>
        <li>responsible</li>
          <li>  patient</li>
            <li>  reserved</li>
              <li>  sensible</li>
                <li>  creative</li>
</ol>

<strong>Blood type and diet</strong>

“Eat Right for Your Type” is a best-selling book that suggests you can achieve your ideal weight and be healthier by choosing a diet based on your blood type. It was written in the 1960s and is still popular today.

The book suggests the following for diet for people with type A+ blood:

    Avoid meat.
    Avoid wheat, corn, kidney beans and dairy.
    Eat seafood, turkey and tofu.
    Eat fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

According to Harvard Medical School, there is no evidence that the diet works.
