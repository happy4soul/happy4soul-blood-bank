    Tough and full of self doubts would suffice my neet journey. I completely my 12th in the year 2020 and this year in 2022 it will be my 3rd attempt.<br><br>
This is the biggest battle in my life where I’m not medically fit (having intense muscle cramps where I couldn’t even move my legs & arms an inch) but despite that I’m studying 18hrs strictly which includes (PW lecture + PYQ’s+ NTA ABHAYAS chapter wise Q&A + ARYAN RAJ’s Target batch material + Allen coaching material).<br><br>

There are days when I’m sick & bearing the pain from cramps. I have also started medication to deal with this health issue. Recently I have started having panic attacks from the fear of not getting selected in AIIMS DELHI.<br><br>

I will give my 300% and the rest is up to my destiny.<br><br>

The path that we are on is full of social pressure, self doubt, hard work and sometimes in my case fighting against health issues.<br><br>
A “NEET ASPIRANT” is itself a huge word.<br><br>

A journey that start’s with million’s of dream’s. You will left everything for that one goal. You will sacrifice your sleep, your friend’s , your cousin’s , even your sibling.<br><br>

You will sacrifice every meetup with friend’s. Every party , every celebration, every festival . For that one ultimate goal MBBS.<br><br>

Day & night you will fight with physics , chemistry & Biology. Even if you are really focused you will surely solve one or two Question in b/w your sleep while you were dreaming. You will get to realise about it at morning when you will really woke up.😂<br><br>

Scoring better score in test will feel like celebration. You will surely reward yourself on that day . When you get satisfactory marks.<br><br>

And, if you are dropper then you have to also tolerate relative’s & freind’s gossip’s & taunt’s .<br><br>

But , at last no matter what , when you will Qualify. You will get big releife . Your hardwork will pay off. Your every wait , every sacrifice will worth.<br><br>
All the best to NEET ASPIRANTS OF 2022
