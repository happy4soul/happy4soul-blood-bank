    People with type A blood -- whether A-negative or A-positive -- are descended from ancient Asian and European vegetarian farmers, claims Peter D'Adamo, the creator of the Blood Type diet. According to D'Adamo, type A individuals are healthier and lose weight more easily if their diet reflects that of their ancestors. The NYU Langone Medical Center, however, recommends against the diet because it is not supported by scientific evidence and requires some individuals, including those with type A blood, to avoid whole categories of foods.<br><br>

<strong>Go Heavy on the Grains</strong> <br><br>

Cereal grains and whole-grain products should be an important part of a type A individual's diet, says D'Adamo. Kasha, buckwheat, amaranth, Ezekiel and Essene breads, and flours such as rice, soy, oat and rye are the most beneficial. Barley, cornmeal, oatmeal, couscous, quinoa, spelt and all types of rice are also permitted. Season cooked grains with most herbs and spices, although red pepper flakes and cayenne aren't advised. Grains for type A people to avoid include all wheat flours, wheat germ, farina and semolina. <br><br>
<strong>Stick to Seafood</strong> <br><br>

Based on the Blood Type diet's premise that a type A's ancestors were mainly agrarian vegetarians, D'Adamo advises them to avoid all beef, pork, lamb and game meats, and to eat lean cuts of chicken or turkey only occasionally. Instead, the type A diet should include up to four weekly servings of seafood, such as salmon, rainbow trout, cod, red snapper, whitefish, sardines or mackerel. Sea bass, swordfish, yellowtail, mahi mahi and albacore tuna are considered less beneficial, while clams, catfish, halibut, mussels, oysters, shrimp and calamari are not recommended. <br><br>
<strong>Pick Plant-Based Proteins</strong> <br><br>

The majority of the protein a type A person consumes on the Blood Type diet is from plant-based sources, including nuts, seeds, beans and legumes. Dairy supposedly inhibits a type A's nutrient metabolism, but soy milk and soy cheese are acceptable. Pumpkin seeds, peanuts and peanut butter, lentils, black-eyed peas and black, pinto and red soy beans are the best choices, purports D'Adamo. Green beans and peas, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds and walnuts are less highly recommended. A type A person following the plan should avoid cashews, pistachios and beans like kidney and lima beans, which are said to slow a type A's metabolism. <br><br>
<strong>Fill Up on Fruits and Vegetables</strong> <br><br>

You'll eat plenty of produce as a type A person on the Blood Type diet. A typical day should include two to six servings of raw vegetables, one to six servings of cooked vegetables and three to four servings of fresh fruit. Focus primarily on produce such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, cherries, blackberries, blueberries, figs, grapefruit, pineapple, onions and garlic. Include dark leafy greens like kale, escarole and collard greens, although asparagus, beets, Brussels sprouts, sea vegetables, zucchini, leaf lettuce, apples, grapes, strawberries and watermelon can also be consumed. Avoid bananas, hot or sweet peppers, potatoes, cabbage, eggplant, tomatoes and oranges.
